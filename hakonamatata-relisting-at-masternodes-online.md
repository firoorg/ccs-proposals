**Proposal**

After rebranding to FIRO some community members noticed that a popular site for listing all the different masternode coins had de-listed ZCoin, now called Firo.

According to the coin update policy at [masternode.online](https://masternodes.online/). Rebrand requires a fee of 500 dollars (In todays price that equals 100 FIRO).

This $500 "maintenance fee" has not been paid, therefore Firo is no longer visible at their site. I purpose that we get together as a community and gather this relatively small fee to get relisted on their page.
