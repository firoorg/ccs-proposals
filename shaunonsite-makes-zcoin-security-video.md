This proposal is for the curation of a new Zcoin explainer video. 

My name is Shaun and I am a freelance videographer and editor.My previous video work for zcoin was the Sigma Protocol
explainer video. 

The purpose of this video is to help explain to those that are new to Zcoin how Zcoin's security measures compares to
the competition. Video is a powerful tool that can be used to showcase how beneficial Zcoin is and I fully believe we
can make this a reality.

In order for this to be done, I will need a script, hire a voice over artist, and the
necessary graphics to complete this project. Once I acquire the necessary funds, I will be able to craft the video 
and have it ready to go for the Zcoin YouTube page and website.

As of this writing, we are sitting at $6.25/XZC. The funds will be divided as follows:
The script is self-explainatory. I will need 32 XZC to have the script written, proofread, and approved for use.
The voice over will be provided by the same person that did the VO for the Sigma Protocol video. 
Her services will require 9 XZC. The curation of the video will be done by me. I require 160 XZC for labor. This equals
to 201 XZC.

If you all believe this needs to be done, I will be more than happy to make this a reality for the Zcoin team!

Thanks for reading and I will answer any questions you all have regarding the project!
